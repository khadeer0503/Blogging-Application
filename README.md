                                     Introduction
A web-based application is any program that is accessed over a network connection using 
HTTP, rather than existing within a device’s memory. Initially, web-based applications were 
developed by Java Server Pages which separated the application into front-end (for the view part, 
mostly HTML code) and back-end (for the application logic part, mostly Java). This segregation
not only makes developing and environmental configurations complicated, but also caused 
maintenance issues.
Framework gained popularity as it implements the Model-View-Controller pattern. It 
offers better platform for better extensibility, scalability and code organization. Spring Boot is a 
framework that makes it easy to create Spring based applications. Spring Boot allows developers 
to select and install dependencies with minimum effort. 
Database is commonly used to store information and data in all kinds of applications 
nowadays. Spring Boot support Object Relational Mapping (ORM), which maps Java classes to 
the corresponding database information. Hibernate is one of the ORM tool that supported by 
Spring Boot to avoid queries written in database.

In this project, a Personal Blog application has been implemented. The application allows 
the administrator to login and post articles, pictures and codes to the blog. And general users can 
read and comment on the blogs.
The contents of this are organized as follows: An overview of 
Spring Boot and Hibernate frameworks, System design and functionalities 
of the Personal Blog with the application.
